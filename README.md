Building a quantum random number generator

A random number generator illustrates quantum behavior and requires only a few lines of code.
On classical computers, most random number generators don't produce truly random numbers, but rather pseudorandom numbers. A pseudorandom number generator generates the same sequence of numbers based on some initial value, called a seed. To better approximate random values, this seed is often the current time from the CPU's clock.

The quantum random number generator uses an H operation to put a qubit into superposition. The measurement results in a zero or a one.
